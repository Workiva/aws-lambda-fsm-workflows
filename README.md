# AWS Lambda Finite State Machine Workflows

(This repo is maintained by an **SSAE 16 SOC 1 Type 2** compliant organization)

A Python 2.7 framework for running Finite State Machine (FSM) Workflows on 

1. [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) for code execution,
1. (Optionally) [AWS ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) for long-running code execution,
1. [AWS Kinesis](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/) for event dispatch
1. (Optionally) [AWS DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) for event dispatch
1. (Optionally) [AWS SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/) for event dispatch
1. (Optionally) [AWS SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) for event dispatch
1. Support for primary and secondary event dispatch mechanisms
1. (Optionally) [AWS DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) for checkpointing
1. (Optionally) [AWS DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) for retries with backoff
1. (Optionally) [AWS SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) for retries with backoff
1. (Optionally) [Memcache](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/) for idempotency
1. (Optionally) [Redis](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/) for idempotency
1. (Optionally) [AWS DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) for idempotency
1. (Optionally) [AWS CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) for error and failure monitoring

or 

1. [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) for code execution
1. (Experimental) [AWS Step Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/) for orchestration and retries,


The FSM implementation is inspired by the paper:
